<h1 align=center>What is hash-mining?</h1>

<h4 align=center>Hash mining is my first every ReactJS application which is a miniature cookie-clicker style game</h4>

<h2 align=center>Where can I play it?</h2>
<h4 align=center>As of now it is not on Github pages although I will add it and I will link it here!</h4>
<h2 align=center>How to play</h2>
<h4 align=center>If you have never played a cookie-clicker style game, its pretty simple to learn. All you have to do is click away and there are ugrades which you can get which can make the "cookies" go up. There is no limit to this game (except you!)</h4>
